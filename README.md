Exploring Developer Tools and Writing Your First JavaScript Script

Objective

This exercise will help you explore browser developer tools (Chrome or Firefox), write your first JavaScript script, and practice using version control by creating a repository. You will demonstrate your work by attaching a video showing the output.
Instructions

    Check Your Browser
        Open either Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox on your computer.
        If you don’t have either installed, download one:
            Google Chrome
            Mozilla Firefox

    Explore Developer Tools
        Open Developer Tools in your browser:
            Chrome: Press Ctrl + Shift + I (Windows) or Cmd + Option + I (Mac).
            Firefox: Press Ctrl + Shift + I (Windows) or Cmd + Option + I (Mac).
        Navigate to the Console tab. This is where you’ll write your first JavaScript code!

    Write Your First Script
        Open the Console and type the following code:
        console.log("Hello, JavaScript!");
        Press Enter and observe the output in the Console. It should display:
        "Hello, JavaScript!"

    Create an HTML and JS File

        Create a folder named js_exercise.

        Inside the folder, create the following files:
            index.html
            script.js

        Add the following code to your files:

        HTML (index.html):
        <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="en"> <head> <meta charset="UTF-8"> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> <title>JavaScript Exercise</title> </head> <body> <h1>Check the Console for Output!</h1> <script src="script.js"></script> </body> </html>

        JavaScript (script.js):
        console.log("This is my first JavaScript script!");

    Run Your HTML File
        Open the index.html file in your browser.
        Open the browser’s Developer Tools, go to the Console, and confirm that the message "This is my first JavaScript script!" appears.

    Create a GitHub Repository
        Create a new repository on GitHub named js-exercise.
        Add your index.html and script.js files to the repository. Commit and push your changes.

    Record a Video
        Record a short video showing:
            The browser you’re using.
            The Console output from Developer Tools.
            Your HTML and JavaScript code in action.
        Save the video in a common format (e.g., MP4) and attach it to your submission.

Submission

Submit the following:

    The link to your GitHub repository.
    The video file showing the output and your code in action.
